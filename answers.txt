#1
answer) 
select site_id, count(distinct(user_id)) 
from data 
where country_id = "BDV" 
group by site_id 
order by count(distinct(user_id)) desc 
limit 1;


#2
answer)
select user_id, site_id, count(*) as number_of_visits 
from data where ts > 20190203 and ts < 20190205 
group by user_id, site_id 
having count(*) > 10;


#3
answer) 
select site_id, count(*) 
from (select user_id, max(ts) as Mts from data group by user_id) as user_Mts, data 
where user_Mts.Mts = data.ts 
group by site_id 
order by count(*) desc 
limit 3;

#4
answer) 
select count(*) 
from (select user_id from data group by user_id having count(*) = 1) as a;

explain) 
I understand the question is asking that counts unique users who visit the site only once during the timestamp data.


#5
answer) 
select site_id, A_counts/B_counts 
from (select site_id, count(distinct(user_id)) as A_counts from data where user_id in 
	(select user_id from data group by user_id having count(distinct(country_id)) > 1) group by site_id) as A 
      natural left join 
     (select site_id, count(distinct(user_id)) as B_counts from data group by site_id) as B 
order by A_counts/B_counts desc
limit 3;

explain) 
I hope the term 'B/A' in question actually means "A devided by B". Otherwise, some sites which have zero (A) will get infinite value.
Additionally, I make a python code which solves the question step by step.
